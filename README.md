# Homeops 🏡⚙️  
_The ops brain for homelabs._

This repo is the **control center** for my homelab:

- Index of all my homelab repos
- Notes, guides, and “what did Past Me do to make this work?”
- Troubleshooting logs so Future Me doesn’t suffer (as much)

Goal: **documented, repeatable home infra** that feels more like a tiny cloud and less like a pile of sticky notes.

***Update**: New [Task board📋](https://github.com/users/pukar10/projects/1)*
